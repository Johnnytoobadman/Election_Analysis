# Election Analysis PyPoll (NOT THE CHALLENGE)

## Overview of Project

A Colorado Board of Elections employee has given the following tasks to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election.:

•	Calculate the total number of votes cast.

•	Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.

•	Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.

•	Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.

•	Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.

## Resources

The resources were provided by the Elections employee and included:

•	Data Source: election_results.csv

•	Software: Python 3.7.6, Visual Studio 1.70.2.

## Summary

### The Analysis of the Election show that:

•	There were 369,711 votes cast in the election.

### The candidates were:

 Charles Casper Stockham

 Diana DeGette
  
 Raymon Anthony Doane


### The Analysis of the election results were: 

 Charles Casper Stockham received 23% of the vote and 85,213 votes.
  
 Diana DeGette received 73.8% of the vote and 272,892 votes.
  
 Raymon Anthony Doane received 3.1% of the vote and 11,606 votes.


### The winner of the election was Diana DeGette who received 73.8% of the votes and 272,892 votes.

## Challenge Overview

•	Establishing list and dictionary variables was difficult

•	Writing the code to determine the winning candidate was extremely challenging.

•	This was only a small sample of the election results with only 3 counties represented out of 51 and 3 candidates in the voting.  In real election results there would be a much larger dataset.

## Challenge summary

•	Python coding is very powerful but requires a lot of preparation, knowledge and planning to write the script accurately. 

•	Visual Studio Code was instrumental is identifying syntax errors, indent errors and more in the long process of working through this project.
